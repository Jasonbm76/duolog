## Architecture Decisions

### 1. State Management: React Context vs. Zustand

**Decision**: React Context with useReducer  
**Rationale**: 
- Project scale doesn't warrant external state library overhead
- Context provides sufficient performance for chat use case
- Follows Murphy Labs preference for built-in React patterns
- Easier debugging and testing without external dependencies
- Future migration to Zustand/Redux is straightforward if needed

**Implementation**: 
```typescript
// ConversationContext with reducer pattern
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(conversationReducer, initialState)
```

### 2. Component Architecture: Co-located vs. Shared

**Decision**: Chat-specific components in `/app/chat/components/`  
**Rationale**:
- Chat components are domain-specific and unlikely to be reused
- Co-location improves developer experience and maintainability
- Clear separation between chat UI and shared UI components
- Follows Next.js App Router best practices

**Structure**:
```
/app/chat/
├── components/     # Chat-specific components
├── context/        # Chat state management
├── hooks/          # Chat-specific hooks
└── page.tsx        # Main chat page
```

### 3. Real-time Simulation: WebSockets vs. Mock Streaming

**Decision**: Mock streaming with setTimeout simulation  
**Rationale**:
- Phase 1 focuses on UI/UX development without API costs
- Realistic typing simulation creates engaging user experience
- Easy to replace with real API streaming later
- Allows testing of all UI states without external dependencies
- Faster development iteration

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Simulated streaming with realistic delays
private static async simulateStreaming(
  fullContent: string,
  onUpdate: (partialContent: string) => void
): Promise<void>
```

### 4. TypeScript Interfaces: Strict vs. Flexible

**Decision**: Strict typing with comprehensive interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents runtime errors common in chat applications
- Improves developer experience with IntelliSense
- Makes future API integration more predictable
- Follows Murphy Labs TypeScript strict mode preference
- Self-documenting code for team collaboration

**Key Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'gpt' | 'claude';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  round: number;
  isStreaming?: boolean;
}
```

## UI/UX Decisions

### 1. Message Layout: Bubbles vs. Feed

**Decision**: Chat bubbles with distinct AI avatars  
**Rationale**:
- Clear visual distinction between AI models
- Familiar chat interface reduces cognitive load
- Avatar icons make conversations scannable
- Round tracking visible in message metadata
- Supports future features like message actions

### 2. Streaming Indicators: Dots vs. Text

**Decision**: Animated dots with contextual text  
**Rationale**:
- Universal chat pattern users expect
- Smooth animations create engagement
- Different states for different AIs
- Low visual noise when multiple messages streaming
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### 3. Round Visualization: Progress Bar vs. Step Indicators

**Decision**: Step indicators with progress states  
**Rationale**:
- Clear understanding of conversation structure
- Visual feedback on progress through 3 rounds
- Supports future features like round jumping
- Familiar pattern from checkout/onboarding flows
- Scales well on mobile devices

## Performance Decisions

### 1. Message Rendering: Virtualization vs. Standard

**Decision**: Standard rendering with scroll management  
**Rationale**:
- 3-round conversations have predictable message count
- Virtualization overhead unnecessary for <20 messages
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Better support for animations and transitions
- Auto-scroll behavior is more straightforward

### 2. Auto-scroll: Smooth vs. Instant

**Decision**: Smooth scrolling with behavior controls  
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience during streaming
- Allows users to track conversation flow
- Prevents jarring jumps during rapid updates
- Configurable for accessibility preferences

```typescript
messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
```

### 3. Re-renders: Optimization vs. Simplicity

**Decision**: Selective optimization with refs  
**Rationale**:
- useRef for processing state prevents infinite loops
- Message updates use specific dispatch actions
- Component memoization only where performance critical
- Follows "optimize when needed" principle

---

## Data Flow Decisions

### 1. Message Updates: Immutable vs. Mutable

**Decision**: Immutable updates with reducer pattern  
**Rationale**:
- Predictable state changes for debugging
- Better React performance with shallow comparison
- Easier to implement undo/redo features later
- Consistent with React best practices
- Time-travel debugging support

### 2. Error Handling: Local vs. Global

**Decision**: Conversation-level error state  
**Rationale**:
- Errors are specific to individual conversations
- Recovery options are context-dependent
- Doesn't affect overall app functionality
- User can retry or start new conversation easily

### 3. Conversation Persistence: Memory vs. Storage

**Decision**: In-memory with cleanup  
**Rationale**:
- Phase 1 doesn't require persistence
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Faster development iteration
- Easy migration to database later
- Privacy-friendly (no data retention)

---

## Integration Decisions

### 1. API Design: REST vs. GraphQL vs. tRPC

**Decision**: Prepare for REST with streaming support  
**Rationale**:
- Simple integration with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Server-sent events for streaming responses
- Standard HTTP status codes for error handling
- Easy to cache and debug
- Future WebSocket upgrade path clear

### 2. Authentication: Required vs. Optional

**Decision**: Optional for Phase 1, prepared for future  
**Rationale**:
- Lower barrier to entry for testing
- Focus on core experience first
- Auth integration planned for Phase 2
- Rate limiting by IP initially
- Smooth upgrade path for user accounts

---

## Mobile Considerations

### 1. Responsive Design: Mobile-first vs. Desktop-first

**Decision**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements  
**Rationale**:
- Many users will access via mobile
- Touch-friendly interface requirements
- Smaller screen space optimization
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Better accessibility compliance

### 2. Input Handling: Auto-resize vs. Fixed

**Decision**: Auto-resize textarea with limits  
**Rationale**:
- Better mobile typing experience
- Handles long prompts gracefully
- Visual feedback for content length
- Prevents viewport issues on mobile
- Standard chat interface pattern

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Mock Data: Static vs. Dynamic

**Decision**: Dynamic mock data with realistic scenarios  
**Rationale**:
- Tests different conversation paths
- Simulates real API response patterns
- Easier to test edge cases
- Content quality affects UX testing
- Demonstrates product capabilities

### 2. Component Testing: Unit vs. Integration

**Decision**: Integration-focused with key unit tests  
**Rationale**:
- Chat components work as a system
- User flow testing is critical
- Conversation state interactions complex
- Mock service integration testing
- Accessibility testing requirements

---

## Future Considerations

### Planned Upgrades (Phase 2)
1. Real API integration with streaming
2. User authentication and persistence
3. Conversation history and search
4. Export and sharing capabilities
5. Custom AI model selection

### Scalability Preparations
1. Component architecture supports new features
2. State management can handle complex flows
3. TypeScript interfaces extensible
4. Performance optimizations identified
5. Error handling patterns established
