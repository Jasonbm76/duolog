# DuoLog.ai

> **Two AI minds. One perfect response.**

DuoLog.ai eliminates the manual copy-paste workflow between ChatGPT and Claude by letting them collaborate directly on your prompts. Watch two AI models refine and improve your ideas through structured conversation, delivering higher quality responses faster than ever.

## üéØ The Problem

Vibe coders constantly switch between ChatGPT and Claude, manually copying responses back and forth to get the best output. This workflow is:
- **Time-consuming** - Multiple tabs, constant switching
- **Error-prone** - Copy-paste mistakes and lost context  
- **Inefficient** - Missing the synergy of AI collaboration
- **Frustrating** - Disrupts flow state during development

## ‚ú® The Solution

DuoLog.ai automates AI collaboration through **role-based conversations**:

1. **Submit one prompt** - No more multiple accounts or tabs
2. **Watch AI collaboration** - See ChatGPT and Claude refine ideas in real-time  
3. **Get superior results** - 3-round refinement ensures thorough optimization
4. **Stay in flow** - One interface, seamless experience
