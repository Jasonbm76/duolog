# PairPrompt MVP Planning Session

*Role-Based AI Collaboration Demo*

## Initial Prompt

"I need to plan the MVP features for PairPrompt.ai - a platform where ChatGPT and Claude collaborate on user prompts through 3 rounds of refinement. Target users are vibe coders who currently copy-paste between AI tools manually."

### User Story Analysis

As a vibe coder, I want to submit one prompt and get a refined response from two AI models collaborating, so that I don't have to manually copy-paste between platforms and can get higher quality outputs faster.

### Key User Personas

- **Primary**: Vibe coders (developers using AI heavily in workflow)
- **Secondary**: College students, content creators, analysts

### MVP Feature Priorities

1. **Core Collaboration Engine** (Must Have)
   - Single prompt input
   - 3-round AI conversation limit
   - Real-time conversation display
   
2. **User Management** (Must Have)
   - 3 free trials for new users
   - Credit-based pricing system
   - Simple auth (email/password)

3. **Conversation History** (Should Have)
   - Save/favorite successful prompts
   - Basic search functionality

4. **Admin Dashboard** (Could Have)
   - Usage analytics
   - Cost tracking
   - Documentation system

### Success Metrics

- Trial-to-paid conversion > 15%
- Average credits consumed per user
- User retention after 1 week

### Acceptance Criteria

- User can submit prompt and see AI conversation in real-time
- System stops after 3 rounds automatically
- Credit system accurately tracks and bills usage
- Mobile responsive design

### Technical Feasibility Assessment

### Architecture Recommendation

```
Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19
Backend: API Routes + Supabase (PostgreSQL)
AI APIs: OpenAI + Anthropic direct integration
Payments: Stripe for credits
Deployment: Vercel
```

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 - Core Engine (Week 1)**
- Basic prompt submission form
- Sequential API calls (ChatGPT ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí ChatGPT)
- Simple conversation display
- No auth required (for testing)

**Phase 2 - User System (Week 2)**
- Supabase auth integration
- Credit system (database schema)
- Usage tracking middleware

**Phase 3 - Polish (Week 3)**
- Real-time conversation UI
- Conversation history
- Payment integration
- Admin dashboard basics

### Technical Risks & Mitigations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement queue system with Redis
2. **Cost Control**: Hard limits on conversation rounds + token monitoring
3. **Latency**: WebSocket connections for real-time updates
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if one API fails

### Database Schema (Critical Tables)

```sql
-- Users & Credits
users (id, email, credits_remaining, created_at)
conversations (id, user_id, prompt, final_output, cost, created_at)
conversation_rounds (id, conversation_id, model, input, output, round_number)

-- Admin & Analytics
usage_analytics (id, user_id, feature, timestamp)
```

**Development Timeline:** 3 weeks to functional MVP

## ü§ù Final Collaboration Synthesis

### MVP Definition Agreed Upon

A streamlined web app where vibe coders input one prompt and watch ChatGPT and Claude refine it through 3 rounds, with credit-based pricing and conversation history.

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up Next.js project with basic UI
2. Implement API route for sequential AI calls
3. Create simple conversation display component
4. Test with hardcoded credits before auth implementation

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Launch on Twitter/X with demo video
- Share in developer Discord communities
- Create content showing before/after prompt improvements

### Success Criteria for Launch

- 100 trial users in first month
- 15% trial-to-paid conversion
- Sub-10 second response times for 3-round conversations
