## 🏗️ Technical Specifications

### Chat Message Interface
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'gpt' | 'claude';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  round: number;
  isStreaming?: boolean;
}

interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  userId?: string;
  messages: Message[];
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'error';
  createdAt: Date;
  totalRounds: number;
}
```

### Component Structure
```
/app/chat/
├── page.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── ChatContainer.tsx
│   ├── MessageBubble.tsx
│   ├── TypingIndicator.tsx
│   ├── PromptInput.tsx
│   ├── ConversationHeader.tsx
│   └── RoundIndicator.tsx
└── hooks/
    ├── useConversation.ts
    └── useStreamingMessage.ts
```

### State Management Approach
- Use React Context for conversation state
- Local state for UI interactions
- Prepare for future Supabase integration
- Consider optimistic updates

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why mock data first**: Allows UI development without API costs
- **Component-first approach**: Ensures reusability across features
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors

### Design Decisions
- **3-round visible flow**: Users see the collaboration happening
- **Streaming responses**: Creates engaging real-time feel
- **Round indicators**: Clear progress through conversation

### Strategic Considerations
- **Broader market messaging**: Less technical jargon
- **Intuitive UI**: Non-developers should understand immediately
- **Mobile-first**: Many users will access via phone

## 🎯 End of Day 3 Goals

By end of day, we should have:
1. ✅ Fully functional chat interface (with mock data)
2. ✅ Beautiful, responsive design
3. ✅ Clear 3-round conversation flow
4. ✅ Updated landing page messaging
5. ✅ Technical documentation started
6. Suggest Tweet for X.com

Ready to build! Let's make Day 3 productive! 🚀
