# üß† DuoLog.ai ‚Äî Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
**Product Name:** DuoLog.ai  
**Tagline:** *Two AI minds. One perfect prompt.*  
**Summary:**  
DuoLog.ai is a modern AI-powered prompt generator that combines Claude and GPT-4 in a cooperative loop to brainstorm, critique, and refine user-submitted prompts. It delivers smarter, more refined outputs by letting the two models collaborate‚Äîresulting in better prompts, faster.

## 2. Target Users

- Indie founders and solo SaaS builders  
- Content creators and marketers using AI tools  
- Developers and prompt-engineering enthusiasts  
- Teams looking for structured prompt refinement

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Single-model prompt generators can feel flat, generic, or incomplete. Users often have to edit or regenerate multiple times. There's no standard tool that brings two powerful LLMs together in a back-and-forth dialogue to get a *"best of both worlds"* outcome.

**DuoLog solves this** by letting Claude and GPT-4 collaborate in real time on user input, refining ideas like a pair of AI co-founders.

### üîπ 1. Landing Page + Waitlist
- One-page site (Next.js + Tailwind)
- Hero section with branding + CTA form
- Three feature highlight blocks
- Email capture form wired to Supabase

### üîπ 2. Prompt Engine API (`/api/prompt`)

- Supabase `users` and `usage_log` tables
- Track # of prompts per user/email
- Limit free-tier usage to 3‚Äì5 prompts

### üîπ 4. Stripe Ready (Stub Only)
- Stripe initialized in dashboard
- Placeholder upgrade buttons or pricing sections
- Billing to be activated post-launch
